A Simple web Appliction in Sinatra
===================================
The intended use of this application is for a manager to assign tasks to each of his employee. Each employee can update the status (open, working or closed) on the tasks assigned to him/her, which can be later verified by the manager. The application has two sections: employee section and managerial section. The latter is protected using basic HTTP authentication. 
Run the application using the command 
 ruby myapp.rb

username and password for basic HTTP authentication:
 username:admin
 password:admin
username and password for manager:
 
 username:admin
 password:admin
 
The limitations :

1. Provide only the basic authentication mechanisms.
2. In this only one manager can assign task to resources.
